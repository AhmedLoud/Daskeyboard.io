# Getting started with your Signals
Even without your 5Q, you can play with Signals by creating, updating and deleting them. To do that, you have several possibilities:
- Connect on Zapier (https://zapier.com) and use the Action called "Q-App". You will be able to create Signals based on triggers such as mails, new Facebook events or even new Youtube videos.
- If you have a Developer Role on Q Cloud, go to the "Dev" section and from there you will find the links to create, update and delete Signals.
- Play with the API, whose documentation can be found here: https://github.com/DasKeyboard/q/blob/master/README.md.

# Roadmap

### TODO

# Known issues

- We have speed issues concerning the server, but we're working on it!
- HTTPS is not implemented for the moment, but it will be very soon.
- Some breaking changes will certainly be made on the Signals API, so if something does not work, make sure you are using the last version of the API (please refer to this link: https://github.com/DasKeyboard/q/blob/master/README.md).
